# Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on
study hours, attendance, and previous academic performance.import pandas as pd

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Creating a simple student dataset
data = {
    'Study_Hours': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    'Attendance': [60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95],
    'Previous_Score': [40, 45, 50, 55, 65, 70, 80, 90],
    'Result': [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]  # 0 = Fail, 1 = Pass
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df

## Dataset Description
- Study_Hours: Number of hours a student studies per day
- Attendance: Attendance percentage
- Previous_Score: Marks obtained in previous exams
- Result: 0 indicates Fail, 1 indicates Pass

# Selecting features (X) and target (y)
X = df[['Study_Hours', 'Attendance', 'Previous_Score']]
y = df['Result']
X, y

 ## Feature Selection
The input features selected for training the model are:
- Study_Hours
- Attendance
- Previous_Score
The target variable is Result, which indicates Pass or Fail.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
X_train.shape, X_test.shape

## Train-Test Split
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
- 80% of the data is used for training
- 20% of the data is used for testing

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Model Training
Logistic Regression is used as the classification algorithm to predict
whether a student will pass or fail based on the selected features.
The model is trained using the training dataset.

# Making predictions on test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
y_pred

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

## Model Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using accuracy and classification report.
Accuracy represents the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
The classification report provides precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Predicting result for a new student
new_student = [[6, 85, 70]]  # Study_Hours, Attendance, Previous_Score
prediction = model.predict(new_student)
print("Prediction:", "Pass" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Fail")

# Predicting result for a new student (without warning)
new_student = pd.DataFrame(
    [[6, 85, 70]],
    columns=['Study_Hours', 'Attendance', 'Previous_Score']
)

prediction = model.predict(new_student)
print("Prediction:", "Pass" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Fail")

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline
including dataset creation, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
The Logistic Regression model effectively predicts student performance.

## Prediction Output
For a new student with 6 study hours, 85% attendance, and a previous score of 70,
the model predicts that the student will Pass.
